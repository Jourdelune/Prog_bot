The actual coding isn\'t the thing developers spend the most time on. It is therefore necessary to take time on how to solve the problems before jumping on your keyboard; ',' use names giving no information on what the code does. A function name for example is supposed to give an idea of ​​what the piece of code does. Otherwise, it becomes difficult to read it again, because you have to go into detail to find out what it does; ',' want to minimize the number of lines in its code at all costs. Being obsessed with having short codes can cause you to sacrifice the readability of your code; ',' ignore error messages. Most of the time, error messages give you enough information to get an idea of ​​what\'s wrong with your code.
